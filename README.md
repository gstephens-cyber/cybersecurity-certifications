# Cybersecurity Certifications Portfolio

This repository documents professional cybersecurity certifications completed as part of my structured progression toward SOC, cloud security, and network security roles.

Each certification is presented with:
- Issuer and completion status
- Skills and security domains covered
- Relevance to real-world security operations
- Alignment with hands-on labs and projects
